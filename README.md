#### Hi there 👋

I'm an alumni of the Univeristy of Kentucky's Master's of Science in Strategic Human Resource Management and Analytics program.

- 🔭 I’m currently working at the University of Kentucky in the HR department

- 🌱 I’m currently learning trigonometry (I never took in high school and want to learn Calc 2 and 3 which you need trigonometry for)

- 💬 Ask me about organizational behavior - I love all things psychometrics!

- ⚡ Fun fact: 12 pioneer beavers were taken to the tip of South America and now there's a colony of over 100,000 of them 😲
